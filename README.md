# The teleoTurtles TR Rules Meta-interpreter in NetLogo
Teleo-Reactive agents, introduced by Nilsson, are software entities that continuously sense the environment, and based on a set of reactive rules trigger actions, whose continuous execution eventually leads the system to satisfy a goal. The Teleo-Reactive approach provides a rather simple way of modelling  model complex goal-driven agents. An excellent source for more information, along with links to relevant literature can be found in [https://teleoreactiveprograms.net](https://teleoreactiveprograms.net).

This is a first attempt to implement the teleoreactive architecure in the NetLogo simulation environment, as a meta interpreter developed entirely in the NetLogo language. The documentation along with the (very simple) installation instructions can be found in the documentation directory. The work found in this repository is described in:
